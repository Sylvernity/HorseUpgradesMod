*Note: Netherite hammers/horseshoes can be created in the smithing table by combining a netherite ingot and a diamond hammer/horseshoe. Netherite horseshoe bars cannot be crafted.*
### 2. Place the Horseshoe Bar on the anvil and hammer until a Horseshoe is formed.

### 3. Equip the Horseshoe to your horse's armor slot and enjoy!
