# ![Image](./src/main/resources/iron_horseshoe.png) Horse Upgrades - Minecraft Forge

This is the GitHub repository for the Horse Upgrades mod, which can be downloaded from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/horse-upgrades).

This mod adds horseshoes to Minecraft, which allow horses to move faster across terrain.

Have you ever found your first horse and immediately been disappointed by its slow speed? Or maybe you only use elytra because of the rarity of fast horses? You need the *Horse Upgrades* mod!

# Features
Horseshoes:
- Increase base horse speed when equipped
- Horses  move faster across terrain
- Tiers include  iron, gold, diamond, and netherite
- Each tier adds a different amount of speed

Horseshoe Bar (Can be iron, gold, or diamond):

*Note: Netherite hammers/horseshoes can be created in the smithing table by combining a netherite ingot and a diamond hammer/horseshoe. Netherite horseshoe bars cannot be crafted.*
### 2. Place the Horseshoe Bar on the anvil and hammer until a Horseshoe is formed:
